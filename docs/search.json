    "text": "Session Description\nSCORE with Data is an NSF-funded project that seeks to build a national network to develop and share high quality materials for using Sports Content for Outreach, Research, and Education in statistics and data science. The SCORE network includes both statistics/data science educators, data professionals from sports teams and sports personalities to guide and review the module development process. A key component of this endeavor is to create a repository of teaching modules that connect interesting sports-related questions with appropriate datasets for classroom use. This includes finding appropriate data and guiding students to produce analyses and results that can be communicated to help participants in the sport answer questions of interest. The materials created for each module include students being asked to communicate the analyses that they are undertaking.\nThis session will introduce participants to the network, engage them with the repository of education modules, review the process for module creation, and discuss how to further engage with and become part of the network. Time permitting, attendees, in small groups, will brainstorm about possible data and questions for further development into a module. As such, it would be helpful for participants to have laptops with internet access for finding data, doing initial analyses, and accessing existing online SCORE modules. Further, interest/experience in one or more sports (as a fan or participant) would be helpful but is not necessary."

In the game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and battle against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. The objective is to destroy the enemy team’s “Nexus,” a structure located in their base. Along the way, players must defeat minions, jungle monsters, and enemy champions to gain gold and experience points, which can be used to purchase items and improve their champion’s abilities.\n\nIdea of game balance\nRestructure the paragraph and introduce the idea of outliers, thorugh the introduction of nerfing and buffing\n\nWithin the world of gaming, the terms “nerfing” and “buffing” are commonly used. “Nerfing” is the act of reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item in a video game, while “buffing” is the act of increasing its power or effectiveness.\n+Introduce the idea that LoL continually collects data evaluates the effect of the champions. Nerfing and buffing as needed. These changes refer to as patches per versions of the game. Patches happen approximately every two weeks.\nThis module uses data from the 12.23 “patch” (version) of the game, within the 5v5 (summoners rift) +introduce the game mode, similar to bball game play, different roles+ to identify if there is a relationship between the win rates associated for every champion.\nA.

    "text": "The dataset ironman1819.csv contains data on female finishers of the Lake Placid Ironman Triathlon from 2002 to 2021. The motivation for this data analysis is to explore the relationships between swim times, bike times, and run times (in minutes) in order to gain insights into the performance patterns of the athletes. By analyzing these relationships, we can understand the interplay between different segments of the race and potentially identify areas of improvement for athletes. For this activity, we will specifically focus on times from finishers in the years 2018 and 2019.\n\nWatch the introductory video for the module.\nGraph and describe the distribution for each leg of the Triathlon\n\n\nSwim Times\nBike Times\nRun Times\n\n\nGraph the following relationships between the legs of the race.\n\n\nSwim Times vs. Bike Times\nRun Times vs. Bike Times\nSwim Times vs. Run Times\n\n\nFrom Question 3, is a correlation an appropriate calculation for these data? If so, guess the correlation between the two legs of the race\nNow, using technology, calculate the correlations and compare them to your guesses\nWhich relationship has the largest correlation? What is a possible reason why we may see this?\nWhich relationship has the smallest correlation? What is a possible reason why we may see this?\nThese data are for finishers of the triathlon. How might these relationships be different for athletes that did not finish or were disqualified?\nWhat do these correlations suggest for athletes about the aspects of their race they want to concentrate on?"
